# Project Description

This project involves exploring sales data from a superstore using SQL queries. The queries cover a range of topics such as identifying the top-selling product types in each state, analyzing the profitability of different products and states, examining the sales trends for specific products, and investigating the correlation between marketing expenses and sales. The queries utilize various SQL techniques such as JOINs, CTEs, time-series analysis, and correlation analysis to derive insights from the data.
